# exasterisk
asterisk
A plugin that allows you to search by the string of the selected part in visual mode.
I want to be able to use asterisks in normal mode in visual mode.

# installation
If you are using vim-plug:
```
Plug "pacificbelt30/exasterisk.vim"
```
you are using something else, I don't know.
